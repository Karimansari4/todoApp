<h1 align="center">Todo List App with UserAuthentication</h1> <br/><br/>

## React Chat App
<p>Create React and Node Application for Authentication and Task CURD Operation.</p>

## Assignment Description:
<p>In this assignment, you will create a Todo List web application with user authentication
features. Users should be able to sign up for an account, log in, and manage their tasks.
Instead of a backend server and database, you can use local storage to simulate user
accounts</p>

## Requirements

### 1. User Authentication
<ul>
    <li>Implement user registration (signup) and login functionality.</li>
    <li>Users should be able to sign up with a username and password.</li>
    <li>Users should be able to log in with their credentials.</li>
    <li>Use forms for both registration and login.</li>
</ul>

### 2. Authentication State
<ul>
    <li>Manage user authentication state using React state.</li>
    <li>Implement protected routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application (e.g., the todo list).</li>
</ul>

### 3. Task Management
<ul>
    <li>Users should be able to create, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks.</li>
    <li>Tasks should be associated with the logged-in user.</li>
    <li>Tasks should persist in local storage, so they are not lost on page refresh.</li>
</ul>

### 4. Logout
<ul>
    <li>Implement a logout button that allows users to log out of their accounts.</li>
</ul>

### 5. User Interface
<ul>
    <li>Create an intuitive user interface with a clean design for both the authentication and todo list parts of the application.</li>
    <li>Display a list of tasks, each with options to edit, mark as completed, and delete.</li>
</ul>

### 6. Error Handling
<ul>
    <li>Provide user-friendly error messages for scenarios such as incorrect login credentials, registration errors, or failed task updates.</li>
    <li>Security Considerations.</li>
</ul>

### 7. User-Specific Data
<ul>
    <li>Ensure that each user can only see and manage their own tasks after logging in. Tasks should be associated with the user who created them.</li>
</ul>

### Bonus Features (Optional):
<ul>
    <li>Add due dates to tasks.</li>
    <li>Implement task prioritisation (e.g., high, medium, low).</li>
    <li>Add the ability to filter tasks by completed and active.</li>
    <li>Implement sorting by due date or priority.</li>
</ul>


### Database Integration (Optional):
<ul>
    <li>If you want to take it a step further, integrate a backend server and database (e.g., Node.js with Express and MongoDB) to store user accounts and tasks securely.</li>
    <li>Implement API endpoints for user registration, login, and task management.</li>
</ul>
